## MR3
  - TaskScheduler supports a new scheduling policy (specified by `mr3.taskattempt.queue.scheme`) which significantly improves the throughput for concurrent queries.
  - DAGAppMaster recovers from OutOfMemoryErrors due to the exhaustion of threads.

## Hive on MR3
  - Compaction sends DAGs to MR3, instead of MapReduce, when `hive.mr3.compaction.using.mr3` is set to true.
  - LlapDecider asks MR3 DAGAppMaster for the number of Reducers.
  - ConvertJoinMapJoin asks MR3 DAGAppMaster for the current number of Nodes to estimate the cost of Bucket Map Join.
  - Support Hive 3.1.2 and 2.3.6.
  - Support Helm charts.
  - Compaction works okay on Kubernetes.
