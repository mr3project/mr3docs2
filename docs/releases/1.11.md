## MR3
  - Introduce `mr3.dag.timeout.kill.threshold.secs` and `mr3.dag.timeout.kill.check.ms` for checking DAG timeout.
  - `mr3.daemon.task.message.buffer.size` specifies the message queue size for DaemonTasks.

## Hive on MR3
  - The cache hit ratio of LLAP I/O is usually higher and more stable because LLAP I/O (with LlapInputFormat) is used only when a Task is placed on nodes matching its location hints.
  - LimitOperator is correctly controlled by MR3 DAGAppMaster (which implements HIVE-24207).
  - Support Hive 4.0.0.
    With the release of Apache Hive 4, we have extended MR3 to support Hive 4 as well as Hive 3.
