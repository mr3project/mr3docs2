## MR3
  - A new DAGAppMaster properly recovers DAGs that have not been completed in the previous DAGAppMaster.
  - Fault tolerance after fetch failures works much faster.
  - On Kubernetes, the shutdown handler of DAGAppMaster deletes all running Pods.
  - On both Yarn and Kubernetes, MR3Client automatically connects to a new DAGAppMaster after an initial DAGAppMaster is killed.

## Hive on MR3
  - Hive 3 for MR3 supports high availability on Yarn via ZooKeeper.
  - On both Yarn and Kubernetes, multiple HiveServer2 instances can share a common MR3 DAGAppMaster (and thus all its ContainerWorkers as well).
  - Support Apache Ranger on Kubernetes.
  - Support Timeline Server on Kubernetes.
