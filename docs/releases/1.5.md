## MR3
  - Use liveness probes on ContainerWorker Pods running separate processes for shuffle handlers.
  - When a ContainerGroup is removed, all its Prometheus metrics are removed.
  - Prometheus metrics are correctly published when two DAGAppMaster Pods for Hive and Spark can run concurrently in the same namespace on Kubernetes.
  - DAGAppMaster stops if it fails to contact Timeline Server during initialization.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.master.pod.cpu.limit.multiplier` for a multiplier for the CPU resource limit for DAGAppMaster Pods.
  - Using MasterControl, autoscaling parameters can be updated dynamically.
  - HistoryLogger correctly sends Vertex start times to Timeline Server.

## Hive on MR3
  - Support Hive 3.1.3.

## Spark on MR3
  - Support Spark 3.2.2.
  - Reduce the size of Protobuf objects when submitting DAGs to MR3.
  - Spark executors can run as MR3 ContainerWorkers in local mode.

## Integrating Hive on MR3 and Spark on MR3

Hive and Spark can complement each other in data warehousing.
For example, Hive lends itself well to serving concurrent requests from end users via HiveServer2,
whereas Spark lends itself well to manipulating data in and out of the data warehouse in a flexible way.
By configuring Hive on MR3 and Spark on MR3 to share Metastore
in the same Kubernetes cluster,
the user can exploit the strengths of both systems.
